(* Definition of a word and a language *)
(* A word is a sequence of ASCII characters, modeled as a list.
   In formal languages, a word is an element of a formal language's alphabet. *)
Definition word := list ascii.



(* A language is a set of words. In Coq, we represent this as a function from words to propositions (Prop),
   which models whether a word belongs to the language.
   
   A language is a function that takes a word as input and returns a proposition (Prop).
   
   *)
Definition language := word -> Prop.



(* The membership relation:
   This definition models set membership for languages. A word [w] belongs to a language [L]
   if applying [L] to [w] returns a proof that the word is in the language. This is similar to set membership in formal languages theory. *)
Definition In (w: word) (L: language) := L w.

   This checks how many characters (elements) are in the word, modeled as a list in Coq. *)

(* Definition of the substring relation between two words:
   A word [x] is a substring of another word [y] if there exist two other words [l1] and [l2]
   such that concatenating [l1], [x], and [l2] gives [y].
   This models the concept of substrings in formal languages. *)

   The power operation repeats the word n times. Below, it is checked for powers 3, 1, and 0. *)

(* Power of 3: ["c"; "a"; "r"] is repeated 3 times, resulting in 
   ["c"; "a"; "r"; "c"; "a"; "r"; "c"; "a"; "r"]. *)
Goal pow ["c"; "a"; "r"] 3 = ["c"; "a"; "r"; "c"; "a"; "r"; "c"; "a"; "r"].

Definition L1 (w:word) := w = ["c"; "a"; "r"].




(* Prove that the word ["c"; "a"; "r"] is in L1.

(* Problem: Define a language L2 that accepts any single vowel (a, e, i, o, u).
   This language is defined as the union of five cases, where each case matches a word containing one vowel.
   In formal languages, L2 can be interpreted as a set containing these specific words. *)

     (* Destruct the assumption N. 
        L2 is a disjunction of cases (["a"], ["e"], ["i"], ["o"], ["u"]).

     (* Inversion inspects each case to see if ["a"; "a"] can match a single-character word like ["a"].
        Since ["a"; "a"] has two characters and each vowel case involves a single character,
        none of these cases can hold, and each case is ruled out.
        This shows that ["a"; "a"] cannot be in L2. *)
