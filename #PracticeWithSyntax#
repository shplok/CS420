(* define an induvtive type natprod which represents a pair of two natural numbers.
we introduce a constructor 'pair' to create pairs of numbers. *)

Inductive natprod : Type :=
  | pair : nat -> nat -> natprod.

(* introduce notation (x,y) to make pairs more readable. *)
Notation "(x , y)" := (pair x y).


Compute (1, 2).
